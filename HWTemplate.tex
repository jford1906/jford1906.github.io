Delete this text and write problem statement here.
\end{prob}
\rev{2/19/18} %Add another of these whenever you submit a proof or it's revisions. Do not delete this or any of the grades that show up below it.
If you want to use the proof environment, it's here. It ends with a nice box to show that the proof is over.

\begin{proof}
If you just type stuff, it shows up as you'd expect. If you need special characters, underlining, overlining, italics, bold, Greek letters, of anything else, the commands are all in the Reference Sheet in Moodle.

If you want some math in the middle of a line, just put it in like this $x^2$ or $x_2$. Notice though, that if you do $x_21$ it doesn't look right. Instead, try $x_{21}$.

Sometimes we want the math to be bigger, so we use $$x^2$$ to center it and make it larger. Especially useful for things like $\sum_{i=1}^n i$ versus $$\sum_{i=1}^n i.$$

When we put a blank line between two paragraphs, we get an automatic indent, but we don't get a blank line.

If we want some small stuff on a line, and no indent on the next line, just end a line with \\
then the next line is just below. Or you can put \\

at the end of a line, then a blank line, and then you get a new line, and a blank line between.

Suppose you need lots of equations lined up over several lines. Try this:

\begin{align*}
f(x) &= x+y\\
&= x-y\\
&=0
\end{align*}


Look, here's a matrix. I added a particular command for this to save you some time.
$$A = \m{1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1}$$




The other thing is that you'll often want to talk about sets. The curly bracket is already a reserved symbol, but we can fix that by putting a backslash in front of it. We can also use the mbox command to put regular text inside of math mode.
$$\R \{x:x \mbox{ is a real number}\}$$
You might need to make bigger notation around things. Something like these cases
$$(\frac{n}{k})$$ $$\left(\frac{n}{k}\right)$$
$$\{\frac{n}{k}\}$$ $$\left\{\frac{n}{k}\right\}$$

Maybe you don't want the fraction bar in there. 
$${n \choose k}$$

Finally, I put in some notation for commonly labelled sets, to save you time.
$$\N \subseteq \Z \subseteq \R \subseteq \C$$

\end{proof}
