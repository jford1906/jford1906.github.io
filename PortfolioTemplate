\section{Narrative}
In this section you can write about the grade you deserve and your argument for why. I recommend you keep the narrative as one section, and the evidence as another. You can keep making sections any way you like. I put some examples below.

You can use references to put a link in the narrative that jumps to the evidence, like this Example~\ref{ex:test}, this Figure~\ref{f:test2} or this Figure~\ref{f:withFrame}.

I usually use ex in my references for examples and f if it's a figure.

\section{Evidence}
\subsection{ELOs}
\subsubsection{ELO1}
Here's some sample evidence\label{ex:test}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Selfie23.jpg}
\caption{You can also put things in a figure environment. That will add a nice label, and you can put a picture in here. Upload a jpg to your Overleaf project and change the name of the file below to get it to appear.}
\label{f:test2}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{framed}
You can also make a figure that doesn't have a picture in it, but instead a frame. That works for things like proofs that are typed, rather than pictures of work from class.
\end{framed}
\caption{You can put this in to separate the text from what's in the box, or to explain what learning objectives the proof demonstrates.}
\label{f:withFrame}
\end{figure}

The labels in this section need to match up with the references in the earlier section.
